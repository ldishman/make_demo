This is my README!

DISCLAIMER: Don't skip ahead. So don't do anything it says here until we're ready to do it together :)

To generate paper.pdf, and plot-data.png like in the lecture, just run `make`

Then, once your `clean` target is set up (Exercise 1), run `make clean` to get back to the state of this repo

If you're interested in playing around with other possibilities for this repo, go crazy!
