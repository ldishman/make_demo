This is my README!

To use, try `git clone --single-branch https://github.com/ldishman/make_demo.git`

To generate paper.pdf, and plot-data.png like in the lecture, just run `make`

NOTE: If you have any issues with plot.py, edit the shebang line at the top to whatever python version you use

Then, once your `clean` target is set up (Exercise 1), run `make clean` to get back to the state of `main`

If you get super stuck, the answers are on branch `dev` (don't look if you can help it!)

If you're interested in playing around with other possibilities for this repo, go crazy!
